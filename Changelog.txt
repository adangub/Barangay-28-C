newBlotter


NOTE: Do serverside validation checks
TO FIX:  (PARA MAKITA ANG MGA BUGS, I IMPORT ANG "28c (with records).sql")
	Ang picture sa residentsummary.php i align right then i offset from the right by mga 20px then magbutang ug FULL NAME naka BOLD sa baba sa pic
	If equal to 3 or more ang related family sa RESIDENTSUMMARY.PHP, maguba ang format 
	Please add ajax loader after mag submit ug residency request AND after mag approve/deny. Preferrably mag DIM ang current webpage then loader sa tunga. Very hard.
	Ayohi ang logout para every page maka logout
	Ang menu button sa tapad anang "Barangay 28C" needs to function
	Ang copyright sa baba (kanang green na bar) dapat sa home lang (naapil sya sa residentsummary.php)
	Ang remember me, should function (login.php)
	Kailangan i categorize ang sidebar. All requests under sa request dropdown, all viewing under sa Viewing na dropdown. 
	Expiry sa cookies is 5 minutes
	View (Residents AND requests) for members ONLY.


Note: New Requests, Change NewTransaction in everythingvalidation. And procedure for NEW_TRANSACTION
